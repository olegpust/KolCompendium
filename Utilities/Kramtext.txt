 Hypothesis:

Sausage Goblins appear after X turns have been spent (via combats) since last encounter with them. The grinder does not need to be equipped to increment this counter.

Testing:
Did not grind any meat into sausages.
Kramco was not equipped until sufficient adventures were spent on combats.

1st Goblin Encounter of the day: 0

Spent 10 turns in charter zone, then equipped grinder: Encountered Sausage Goblin
Spent additional 10 turns, equipped grinder: Encountered Sausage Goblin
Repeated process 2 more times with same results.

For sausage goblins 5 through 7, I spent 20 adventures (on combats) before equipping the grinder again. After equipping the grinder, the next combat was a sausage goblin.
